# gopen

Open a file/repo in Github. If you specify a file, it will open that one, if you don't, it will just go the repo.

Works with Github Enterprise, doubtful for Bitbucket, doesn't for Google code.

# Why?

I'm not always in Vim, so can't rely on Tim Pope's https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive which I stole the idea from and I guess the code.

# Is this worthy of a git repo?

Probably not, but at least you can do pull requests for it.
